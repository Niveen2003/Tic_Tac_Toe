# Tic_Tac_Toe
This repository hosts a simple yet functional Tic Tac Toe game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. Each button acts as a cell where players can place their marks, either 'X' or 'O', by clicking on the cell. The game alternates between players, starting with 'X'.
The core of the game’s functionality is handled by JavaScript. It includes logic to determine the game's state, such as checking for win conditions and ties. The game employs predefined win patterns, which include all possible horizontal, vertical, and diagonal combinations. When a player achieves a winning pattern, an alert is displayed to announce the winner. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game detects a tie and informs the players accordingly.
To manage the game’s state, the JavaScript code includes event listeners that respond to cell clicks. When a cell is clicked, the script updates the cell with the current player's mark, checks for a win or tie, and then switches the turn to the other player. If a win or tie is detected, it disables further clicks on the board until the game is restarted.
The user interface is styled with CSS to ensure a pleasant visual experience. The game board is displayed as a grid with evenly spaced cells. Hover effects are applied to enhance user interaction, and the restart button is prominently styled to make it easy for players to start a new game. The CSS also ensures that the game board is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on various devices.
Overall, this implementation provides a straightforward and engaging Tic Tac Toe game with clear game logic, user-friendly design, and simple restart functionality.
